== em_mw_xlink
EventMachine MediaWiki eXternal Link is an event machine IRC Bot intended to grab revision data from the Wikipedia IRC revision announcement channels. 
This code is written as part of a engineering senior design project at the University of Pennsylvania.

== Connection
To connect the IRC bot to the english language announcement channel, run the em_mw.rb file in the bin directory with the `start' command. For example,

$ ruby bin/em_mw.rb start

You probably also want to start the watcher - an EventMachine based monitor that stops and restarts the bot if the database file stops groups. See --help for more options. 

To disconnect, run the stop.rb file in the bin directory. 
$ ruby bin/em_mw.rb stop
  

== Tests
Tests are in the test/ directory, and can be run doing:
$ ruby test/the_test.rb

To run all the tests do:

$ cat test/*.rb | ruby


== Commands
